# JS-Animations
I wanted to learn how to make complex animations using JavaScript.
I made a two pages that use GSAP and ScrollMagic (both are JS libaries). 
I learned a lot and I wanted to share this with you.
## How to see the animations
Unfortunately if you want to see the animations you would have to download the files
and run a local server, I reccomend simply opening the project in VS code, install the LiveServer extension, right click on index.html and click 'Open with live server'.
